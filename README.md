My name is Carlo. I am a Data Scientist based out of Berlin, Germany. My industry experience includes **Rocket Internet**, **Deloitte**, **Foodora**, **Delivery Hero**, and consulting. What excites me most about Data Science is leveraging machine learning and big data tech to build deployable, data-driven products that bring tangible value to people's lives.

Below are some personal projects that I've worked on in the past. More to come soon!

## Project 1: [Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/carlo-olmi/portfolio/blob/master/Cohort%20Analysis/Cohort%20Analysis.ipynb)
Cohort analysis can be helpful when it comes to understanding your business’ health and "stickiness" - the loyalty of your customers. Stickiness is critical since it’s far cheaper and easier to keep a current customer than to acquire a new one. For startups, it’s also a key indicator of product-market fit.
Additionally, your product evolves over time. New features are added and removed, the design changes, etc. Observing individual groups over time is a starting point to understanding how these changes affect user behavior.
It’s also a good way to visualize your user retention/churn as well as formulating a basic understanding of their lifetime value.

## Project 2: [Visualizing My Music Taste using Machine Learning](https://github.com/carlo-olmi/portfolio/tree/master/Visualizing%20My%20Music%20Taste%20using%20Spotify%20API%20and%20Machine%20Learning)
How would you go about describing your favorite new song? What makes it catchy to you? According to the people at Spotify, characteristics like energy or mood of a song can actually be quantified, and have many algorithms to describe music in an amazing amount of ways.

## Project 3: [An ultimate guide to A/B Testing](https://github.com/carlo-olmi/portfolio/blob/master/AB%20Tesing/Frequentist%20AB%20and%20more.ipynb)
A/B testing is essentially a simple randomized trial. Randomized trials are (usually) considered the gold standard study design for evaluating the efficacy of new medical treatments, but they are also used much more widely in experimental research.
In web analytics, A/B testing (bucket tests or split-run testing) is a controlled experiment with two variants, A and B. It is a form of statistical hypothesis testing or "two-sample hypothesis testing" as used in the field of statistics. In online settings, such as web design (especially user experience design), the goal of A/B testing is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest (e.g., click-through rate for a banner advertisement).
