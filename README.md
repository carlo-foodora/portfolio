My name is Carlo. I am a Data Scientist based out of Berlin, Germany. My industry experience includes **Rocket Internet**, **Deloitte**, **Foodora**, **Delivery Hero**, and consulting. What excites me most about Data Science is leveraging machine learning and big data tech to build deployable, data-driven products that bring tangible value to people's lives.

Below are some personal projects that I've worked on in the past. More to come soon!

## Project 1: [Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/carlo-olmi/portfolio/blob/master/Cohort%20Analysis/Cohort%20Analysis.ipynb)
Cohort analysis can be helpful when it comes to understanding your business’ health and "stickiness" - the loyalty of your customers. Stickiness is critical since it’s far cheaper and easier to keep a current customer than to acquire a new one. For startups, it’s also a key indicator of product-market fit.
Additionally, your product evolves over time. New features are added and removed, the design changes, etc. Observing individual groups over time is a starting point to understanding how these changes affect user behavior.
It’s also a good way to visualize your user retention/churn as well as formulating a basic understanding of their lifetime value.
