My name is Carlo. I am a Data Scientist based out of Berlin, Germany. My industry experience includes **Rocket Internet**, **Deloitte**, **Foodora**, **Delivery Hero**, and consulting. What excites me most about Data Science is leveraging machine learning and big data tech to build deployable, data-driven products that bring tangible value to people's lives.
