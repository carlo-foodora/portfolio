Application Program Interfaces, or APIs, are commonly used to retrieve data from remote websites. Sites like Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook all offer certain data through their APIs. To use an API, you make a request to a remote web server, and retrieve the data you need.

## API Requests
APIs are hosted on web servers. When you type www.google.com in your browser’s address bar, your computer is actually asking the www.google.com server for a webpage, which it then returns to your browser.

APIs work much the same way, except instead of your web browser asking for a webpage, your program asks for data. This data is usually returned in JSON format (for more on this, checkout our tutorial on working with JSON data).

In order to get the data, we make a request to a webserver. The server then replies with our data. In Python, we’ll use the requests library to do this. In this Python API tutorial we’ll be using Python 3.4 for all of our examples.
